Usage: 
Run python create.py to generate an initial set of HTML pages
which you can then manually tune to best suit your needs. In most cases, 
this bare-bones site should be minimalistically appealing and work well as a
portfolio.

Pre-requisite: A basic knowledge of HTML is required to understand how to
further refine the output of this python script to suit your needs.

Auto-site builds for you an academic-style web presence in minutes using
the powerful Bootstrap from Twitter, and certain design aesthetic principles
You can arbitrarily add sections or choose from a set of preset ones defined
here, to get the barebones structure of your website, which can be further
tweaked from the HTML/JS source.
The required libraries are Bootstrap and jQuery, both of which are already
included in this directory.

All you have to do is open constants.py, change a few things as per your need
and run create.py
